Server for stable, curated Haskell package sets

This repo is part of the [Stackage project](https://github.com/fpco/stackage),
and the live server can be viewed at https://www.stackage.org.

Inside the config directory, there are two files ending in `-sample`. They
should be copied to remove the `-sample` suffix for the site to work. We do it
this way to avoid accidentally committing real database credentials into the
Git repository.
